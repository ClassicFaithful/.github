## Ever since 2010, Faithful's goal has been simple: Provide a higher-resolution version of the default Minecraft textures while staying true to the originals. Now, it is available for Bedrock Edition, many older versions of Minecraft from 1.6-1.18, in multiple resolutions, art styles, and with both Jappa and Programmer Art variants.

Faithful is also fully community-driven, free, and open source, meaning all textures are provided by volunteering contributors working in their free time. If you'd like to help out by drawing textures, or if you want something changed about a pack, you can become one too! Simply join our Discord server using [this link](https://discord.gg/KSEhCVtg4J) so you can get started at making and submitting a texture.

For those that like a more detailed, modern style, check out our sister project at https://faithfulpack.net!
