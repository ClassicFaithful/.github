## Classic Faithful is an official continuation of Vattic's 1.8 Faithful resource pack for Minecraft, maintaining the original Faithful look and feel under his time. Not only do we have the original 32x Programmer Art resource pack, but we've expanded to the post-1.14 "Jappa" textures and other resolutions.

# All of our work is free, open sourced, and without any ads or data collection, and will always continue to be so.
